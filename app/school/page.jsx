      title: "Navigation and Usability",
      desc: "Staff members initially found the platform difficult to navigate and unintuitive. Common tasks such as accessing the dashboard, managing pupil records, or locating timetables were not easily discoverable. The experience was particularly challenging for those with limited digital literacy.",
    },
    {
      title: "Staff and Pupil Profile Management",
      desc: "Users were unclear on how to create or update profiles for staff, students, or guardians. Inconsistencies in form layouts and missing guidance led to incomplete records and administrative errors.",
    },
    {
      title: "Filter and Search Confusion",
      desc: "The filtering system lacked clarity, with vague terminology and little explanation. Teachers and admin users struggled to filter students by year, subject, or attendance status effectively.",
    },
    {
      title: "Assessment and Report Entry",
      desc: "The process for entering assessment data and generating reports was seen as tedious and error-prone. Unclear terminology, multiple clicks, and lack of autosave functionality contributed to user frustration.",
    },
    {
      title: "User Confidence and Engagement",
      desc: "Early versions of the system lacked the visual polish and trustworthiness needed for users to fully adopt it. Some users hesitated to use it consistently or recommend it to colleagues, citing unreliability and poor user experience.",

    },
    {
      title: "Streamlined Profile Management",
      desc: "We introduced a guided form builder for staff and student profiles, with contextual tooltips and validation. The new design ensures essential data is captured correctly, while bulk editing options help administrators save time.",
    },
    {
      title: "Clear and Contextual Filtering",
      desc: "Filter options were rewritten using plain language and organised into logical groups. Icons and real-time feedback were added to show results immediately. A short guide was provided for new users encountering filters for the first time.",
    },
    {
      title: "Optimised Assessment Workflow",
      desc: "The assessment module was refined to allow inline editing, auto-saving, and clearer section headers. A simplified three-step process now allows teachers to enter grades, add comments, and generate reports with fewer errors and delays.",

    {
      title: "Enhanced Trust and Adoption",
